Modern Authentication
 SAML - exchangig tokens for authentication & authorization. web browser(sso) & api's
 OAuth - a standard for delegation. for ex, a webiste asks to register with facebook. website doesnt have our password. mostky social media.
         A is allowed to do B set of things (B meaning permissions)
 OpenId - using better version of Oauth2.0
 PKCE
 Federation - Azure AD relies on ADFS to connect to on premise AD. Dont worry too much as dev
